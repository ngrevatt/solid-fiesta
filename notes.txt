1. generate data presents data as it should come in over TLS 
    (padded to 80 bytes, fully encrypted, 
    and impossible to use in its current state)

2. my old code passed a pointer to fullData to reallocate it if I read too many lines 
    (I should build this in later)! . . . if more than ALLOC records

3. converting between char arrays and uint8_t arrays for oaes() - nasty, but should work
    - the spacing with the bytes and everything is in check, time to make?   

4. can I convert my unpad code from python to C? (might be frustrating)

REVEAL PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE CALLED FOR EVERY CHARACTER (THUS A POINTER?)


NEW STUFF:
- should I call load_data (to populate io) outside the timer? should this be timed?
        -> I opted YES
-??? where should the reveal occur? in main or in called obliv function?

- should my calculating function be void? or obliv? what should the return type be? maybe the array of opersonstructs?

for linreg, io->src is used from inside the .oc file to load data into two normal 
    arrays which are then used to feed into the obliv arrays

    however, I load all of the data into the io, outside of the time, 
    why is it done this way? am I doing it the wrong way?


!! MAKE SURE alloc actually matches # of keys!!!!

1:55 PM thursday - is my code hanging? or is AES just very slow? linreg is under a second


ENCRYPTION KEY = DPO_key XOR DC_key (two 128 bit AES keys?)
 ->>> WILL THIS WORK?
